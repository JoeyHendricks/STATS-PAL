class StatisticalDistance:
    """
    This class is an algorithm that uses the kolmogorov smirnov statistics
    to define how much distance there is between a baseline and a benchmark
    test execution.
    To interpret how much distance is to much for us we use an heuristic
    to make sense of our statistics to make an best effort estimation
    if we tolerate a change or not.
    This is done by letter ranking the kolmogorov smirnov and Wasserstein
    distance statistic from the S to F (using the Japanese ranking system),
    alternatively a score from 0 to 100 can also be used or the distance
    value itself can also be used to interpret the results and make a quick
    decision whether to accept the change or refuse it.
    Using this approach to rapidly perform an baseline versus benchmark analysis
    we can fit this method into a CI/CD pipeline to be able to do a accurate
    performance analysis in an automated fashion.
    Keep in mind that this approach leans toward being a heuristic method because
    of the unpredictable nature of performance test results it is difficult
    to create a model that will fit a very wide array of test results.
    The models used in this class can there for be consider as a general guideline
    which can be adjusted to fit your own need.
