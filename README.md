<!-- INTRO -->
## In a nutshell what is this project is all about?

Continuous performance testing is nothing new, but one of the biggest pitfalls of a reliable automated performance 
test is the analysis of its results. 
Automatically deciding if there is a significant change in behavior between your baseline and benchmark run goes 
beyond just verifying only simple metrics around your response time.
