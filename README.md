<!-- INTRO -->
## In a nutshell what is this project is all about?

Continuous performance testing is nothing new, but one of the biggest pitfalls of a reliable automated performance test 
is the manual analysis of its results. This manual intervention slows down the pace required to keep up with our ever 
more demanding online world. 

By verifying automatically if there's a significant change in behavior between your baseline and benchmark 
we can speed up our testing effort, reduce our time to market and liberate a performance engineer to 
focus on more pressing matters.

This project hopes to bring a helping hand to performance engineers around the globe by providing them with a 
solution that can be embedded in their testing process to reliably perform complicated 
analysis in an automated fashion.
